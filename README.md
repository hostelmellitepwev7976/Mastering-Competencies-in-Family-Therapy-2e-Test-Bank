        * MASTERING COMPETENCIES IN FAMILY THERAPY: A PRACTICAL APPROACH TO THEORY AND CLINICAL CASE DOCUMENTATION, 2nd Edition provides a competency-based approach to teaching clinical skills in marriage and family therapy-an approach adopted by the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy (AAMFT). Using a light and inviting tone, author Diane R. Gehart offers a comprehensive five-step model for competent treatment, which guides readers through case conceptualization, clinical assessment (diagnosis) and case management, treatment planning, evaluation of progress, and documentation. The book also includes an introduction to the importance of theory and evidence-based practice in all five steps, and a set of useful clinical forms that can be applied in practice environments.
